# Acknowledgments

This project is the result of a collaborative effort, combining academic guidance, powerful developer tools, and dedicated teamwork. We would like to express our gratitude to the following people and organizations.

## 🎓 Academic Guidance

First and foremost, we extend our sincere thanks to **Dr. Alessandro Bruno** and **IULM University**.

The invaluable guidance provided during the **"Data Mining & Text Analytics"** course laid the theoretical foundation for this work and gave us the necessary skills to apply NLP techniques to real-world data.

## 🛠️ Resources

We thank **Google API Services** for providing the developer tools that allowed us to extract YouTube comments, experiment with large datasets, and analyze fan sentiment effectively.

## 👩‍💻 The Team

This project was a **100% team effort** by **Alice Maestri**, **Chiara Saponara**, and **Eleonora Maraccini**. While we collaborated closely on every phase of the pipeline, we would like to highlight our individual contributions:

* **Chiara Saponara**
    * Conceived the initial idea to run sentiment analysis on movie and TV series commentary.
    * Established the initial project setup and created the data extraction pipeline (`data_acquisition.py`).
    * Developed the prototype for the sentiment analysis logic (`sentiment_analysis.py`).

* **Alice Maestri**
    * Refined and improved the initial codebases to create the final, accessible, and production-ready versions.
    * Managed the project documentation, including writing the `README` file and structuring the final GitHub repository.
    * Assisted Chiara in the implementation of each development step.

* **Eleonora Maraccini**
    * Provided comprehensive assistance at every stage of creation, including research and code writing.
    * Responsible for testing the code at each iteration to ensure stability.
    * Proofread and validated all documentation and code outputs throughout the pipeline.
